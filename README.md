# Digital Sufism
## A Project to make available materials for the study of early Sufism<br>(3rd/9th-4th/10th centuries) in a digital format

This is the landing page for the development of the **Digital Sufism** project, which is actively developed by Jeremy Farrell and other collaborators. Code for elements of the project can be found on the [blog](https://zurstadt.github.io/digitalsufism/blog.html), and more advanced applications of the materials discussed on these pages are described in the [Future Directions] page. For other academic projects, see Jeremy's [CV](https://zurstadt.github.io/digitalsufism/cv.html).
