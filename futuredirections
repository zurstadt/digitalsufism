This site is meant to serve as a stand-alone resource for the study of early Sufism, but several ongoing projects that intersect with its aims are also currently in development. In general, the vision for this interlinking ecosystem of projects is to realize a **comprehensive**, **rigorous**, and **intuitive** platform for conducting research and computational analysis of early Sufi literature, especially the extant corpus described on the [Primary Sources](https://zurstadt.github.io/digitalsufism/primarysources) page. When these projects go live, either through publication of their own dedicated site, a link will be provided to access them.


### A Catalogue of "Lost" early Sufi works 

Although the works listed in the Primary Sources page form the necessary core of any study of Sufism as a historical phenomenon, it is also important to recognize that there once existed another large cache of works that have not been preserved (cf. Massignon, _Passion_<sup>2</sup>, IV, pp. 6ff; Karamustafa, _Sufism: The Formative Period_ (2007), [pp. 84-85](https://books.google.ae/books?id=f-9Q_cC_1Z4C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=table%204.1&f=false "Read online")). However, the documentation of evidence concerning these lost works in modern studies is fragmentary, and attributions of titles are often erroneous. This study will provide an exhaustive examination of both Sufi and non-Sufi bio-bibliographical literature in order to provide a comprehensive view of the extent of literary activity by early Sufis.

### _FIdEIST_ Database (_F_ igures and _I_ snā_d_s of _E_ arly _I_ slamic _T_ exts)

A comprehensive [non-relational database](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/what-is-a-non-relational-database) of information encoded in _isnād_-based Sufi works from the 3rd/9th through 5th/11th centuries. The choice of a non-relational database is appropriate, for two reasons. **First**, and despite the name, most non-relational databases are capable of handling **highly structured** classes of data, as is encoded in _isnād_s; this would include not only the directed pathways and texts of the sayings that were transmitted along them, but also the (infrequently recorded) metadata about this process, such as technical terms of citation, and dates and locations of specific transmission instances.<br>
**Secondly**, the ability of non-relational databases to handle **highly un-structured classes of data** that relate to individual figures who appear in the _isnād_ s. Primarily, this refers to biblio-biographical data, such as: full accounting of names (_kunyah_s, _ism_, and various _nisbah_s); birth / death dates; lists of teachers and students from biographical dictionaries; lists of extant and lost works (see above); and, when available, opinion matrices provided by other Muslim scholars.

At later stages, it is envisioned that the data in non- or partially _isnād_-based works will also be incorporated into the database, and that the dataset will also become available through an app that will support visualization and citation capabilities.
